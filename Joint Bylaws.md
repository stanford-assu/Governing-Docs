      2. In the event of an excess refund amount, the Financial Manager is authorized to collect that amount from the group’s accounts in the following order:
         1. Fee Reserves
         2. Operating Budgets
         3. All other assets as specified in the contract signed prior to being placed on the ballot
1. The Financial Manager shall advertise deadlines as appropriate to ensure students are aware of these procedures.
2. Additional refund policies, specific to either the graduate or undergraduate population, shall be included in the By-Laws of the relevant Association legislative body.

G. Enforcement
The Financial Manager is hereby instructed and empowered to ensure that all requirements pertaining to funds derived from General and Special Fees and Annual, Standard, and Quick Grants contained in the Constitution, these By-Laws, the US By-Laws, the GSC By-Laws, and Funding Policies enacted by the relevant Association legislative bodies are strictly enforced.

The relevant candidate, slate, or sponsor shall be given at least 24 hours advance notice of the time and place of the hearing.

However, the relevant legislative bodies shall have the discretion to determine the validity of any action of the Commission.
   9. In making this determination, the relevant legislative bodies shall consider whether or not the alleged acts were in fact committed, whether or not they constitute a violation of the By-Laws or Policies of the relevant Association legislative bodies, and whether or not they are sufficiently serious or affect a significant enough number of petition signatures to justify invalidation.
   10. Should the relevant legislative bodies determine that invalidation was not justified, then the appeal shall be granted and the appropriate candidate, slate, Special Fee request, or ballot measure shall appear in the Elections Handbook and on the ballot, provided that all other requirements for appearance on the ballot have been satisfied.

   1. The Commission shall verify all signatures as they are submitted, provided that an appropriate declaration of intent is on file.
   2. All petitions that do not meet the specifications detailed in the Constitution, the Association By-Laws, the US By-Laws, the GSC By-Laws, the Charge of the Commission, and these Policies shall first be declared invalid. All other petitions shall be declared valid. The Commission shall have the authority to waive any defects in the form of a petition, if in its opinion the defects were not so serious as to prevent members of the Association from making an informed decision as to whether or not to provide their signature for that petition.
   3. The number of signatures submitted in support of the candidates, slate, or sponsor shall be the total number of signatures submitted in each valid petition, less any signatures that are not complete, as specified in the Constitution, the Association By-Laws, the GSC By-Laws, the US By-Laws, and these Policies.
   4. Petitions supported by fewer than the number of signatures required shall be declared invalid; otherwise the signatures shall be verified.
   5. Verification of a signature shall consist of a comparison of both the associated name and student identification number in a list of registered students prepared by the Registrar. If the exact student identification number is in the list and the name reasonably matches the corresponding name in the list, or the exact name is in the list and the student identification number reasonably matches the corresponding number in the list, and if the individual in question is a member of the appropriate district or class, then that signature shall be considered valid. Otherwise, it shall be considered invalid. An “exact match” of a name shall consist of a last name, and either a first name or a middle name which exactly match those found in the list provided by the Registrar.
   6. In determining whether names or numbers “reasonably match”, those verifying shall, within the limits of the relevant rules, err on the side of accepting a signature that seems to have been made in good faith by someone entitled to sign the petition. In particular, different word orders, and use of informal names shall not necessarily prevent names from “reasonably matching”. If the Registrar is in the process of changing student identification number format, either format shall be considered valid.
   7. The Commission shall prepare a written report stating, for each petition submitted, the number of signatures submitted, the number of signatures verified, the number found to be invalid, and whether or not the petition as a whole was valid or invalid. For the Spring Quarter General Election, this report shall be transmitted to the President of the Association and the Chairs of the relevant Association legislative bodies no later than the last day of the End- Quarter Period during Winter Quarter.
1. Re-verification
   1.  Any candidate, slate, or sponsor may request a reverification of a petition by filing a re-verification request within 72 hours after the announcement by the Commission of the results of the initial verification of the petition.
   2. All re-verification requests shall contain the name of the requesting party, her/his local address and phone number, and either a $50 bond (for candidates and slates) or a $250 bond (for sponsors), to be placed on deposit with the Students’ Organizations Fund.
   3. A request shall be considered filed upon receipt by the Elections Commissioner of the request and by the Students’ Organizations Fund of the bond.
   4. The Commission shall then verify each signature submitted in support of the petition.
   5. If there are fewer valid signatures in support of the petition than required, then the petition shall be declared invalid and the bond credited to the budget reserve of the Commission; otherwise the petition shall be declared valid and the bond refunded.
   6. If on the basis of the reverification a petition is declared valid, when it was initially declared invalid, or if a petition is declared invalid when it was initially declared valid, then the bond shall be refunded by the Students’ Organizations Fund; otherwise the bond shall be forfeit, and shall be credited to the budget reserve of the Commission.
D. Officers

2. Other signature requirements will be listed in the By-Laws or Policies of the relevant Association legislative bodies.
3. The relevant By-Laws may specify additional positions for which only members of the relevant population run and vote for.
E. Special Fee Requests
1. In order for its Special Fee request to be placed on the ballot, a student organization must qualify under one of the following provisions:
   1. Voluntary Student Organizations: organizations which are intended to be (and actually are) primarily composed of student members, require no student to join, are recognized by the University, and are either open to all students or open to only those students meeting certain criteria which are established and evaluated in an objective manner by the organization. In order to qualify under this provision, the ultimate constitutional, budgetary, and policy- making authority of the organization must be vested entirely in its student members.
   2. Chartered Organizations: organizations which are intended to be (and actually are) primarily composed of student members, require no student to join, are recognized by the University, and are either open to all students or open to only those students meeting certain criteria which are established and evaluated in an objective manner by the organization, but where the ultimate constitutional, budgetary, and policy-making authority are vested in a University office or committee or any body other than its student membership.
      1. Such an organization shall have a Special Fee request placed on the ballot only with the express consent of the relevant Association legislative bodies. This consent shall take the form of a resolution certifying that, in the opinion of the relevant Association legislative bodies, the organization and its finances are in fact essentially under the control of students, and shall require for approval a 2/3 vote. At the time that this resolution is approved, the relevant Association legislative bodies may specify additional criteria under which the Special Fee request is placed on the ballot, which shall be as binding on the organization as is its detailed budget. Approval of this resolution shall only determine the organization’s eligibility to receive a Special Fee, and shall be independent of, and in addition to, any action by the relevant Association legislative bodies actually placing the request on the ballot.
      2. In the event that the constitution, structure, finances, policies, or operations of such an organization is substantially modified, as defined by the relevant Association legislative bodies, so as to impair student control and/or prevent the Special Fee funds from being used for the purposes for which they were originally intended, the relevant Association legislative bodies may by a 2/3 vote pass a resolution halting the disbursement of Special Fee funds to that organization. Upon the approval of such a resolution, any and all Special Fee funds already disbursed to the organization shall revert to the Association and shall be placed in the relevant population’s Buffer Fund. If a joint group, then the funds shall be split into the Graduate and Undergraduate Buffer Funds to reflect the monetary contributions of each population.
1. An agency of the Association shall have its Special Fee request placed on the ballot only with the consent of the relevant Association legislative bodies. This consent shall only determine the organization’s ability to seek a Special Fee, and shall be independent of, and in addition to, any action by the relevant Association legislative bodies actually placing the request on the ballot.
2. An agency of the Association requesting a Special Fee must be not otherwise financially dependent on the Association.
3. If a Special Fee request which has met all Elections Commission deadlines is left off the ballot, then the request may be funded from the relevant population’s Special Buffer Fund by a 2/3 vote of the relevant Association legislative bodies.
4. Any student organization seeking a Special Fee may submit a petition of members of the Association to the Commission. The information pages in each petition shall contain:
   1. the detailed budget for the organization submitted for the following fiscal year;
   2. the original detailed budget for the current fiscal year, if applicable;
   3. the most recently modified budget for the current fiscal year, if applicable;
   4. an accounting of the expenses of the current fiscal year to date, if applicable;
   5. an estimate of the expenses for the remainder of the current fiscal year, if applicable;
   6. the population from which the fee is being sought (i.e., undergraduate students, graduate students, or both); g. current reserve balances.
1. A detailed budget shall be a line item estimate of all planned expenditures and expected revenues, and their particular sources, to be generated by activities of the student organization during a fiscal year. This budget must contain line items for gross Fee assessment income and Fee assessment refunds, the latter to be a percentage of the former, this percentage being referred to as the budgeted refund rate.
2. As part of its declaration of intent, Special Fee application, and detailed budget each student organization seeking a Special Fee must declare from which population it is seeking its Special Fee. This decision should be based on consideration of the demographics of the student organization’s membership, audience, users of services provided, or other criteria as determined by the relevant Association legislative bodies or their designee(s). The designee(s) of the Association legislative bodies shall advise student organizations as to which population would be appropriate for funding given the particular student organization’s characteristics. 
3. A returning special fee group desiring to change its funding population must re-petition the relevant population as specified in Article V, Section 2.A.6.a or Article V, Section 2.A.6.b of the ASSU Constitution. This does not apply to groups changing their funding population from Joint to Graduate or Undergraduate.
4. Special Fee Refund Rates
   1. The budgeted refund rate shall be based upon estimates prepared by the Financial Manager of the actual refund rates incurred during the current fiscal year for each Special Fee.
   2. If the Special Fee request is not placed on the ballot by the action of the relevant Association legislative bodies, then the budgeted refund rate shall be approved by a procedure specified in the respective By-Laws of the relevant Association legislative bodies, provided that this rate shall not be less than either the actual refund rate for that organization during the current fiscal year (if there was a Special Fee collected for that organization during the current fiscal year) or that the lowest actual refund rate incurred of any Special Fee during the current fiscal year (if no such Special Fee was collected during the current fiscal year).
   3. The relevant Association legislative bodies shall approve a budgeted refund rate for a student organization by either the Friday of the sixth week of Winter quarter, or at the meeting which occurs at least 48 hours after the student organization presents their budgetary and other financial information to the Elections Commission, Financial Manager, and the relevant Association legislative bodies, whichever occurs later.
   4. If the relevant Association legislative bodies fail to approve a budgeted refund rate on a timely basis, then this rate shall be either the actual refund rate for that organization’s Special Fee during the current fiscal year (if there was a Special Fee collected for that organization during the current fiscal year), or the median of the actual refund rates incurred for all Special Fees during the current fiscal year (if no such Special Fee was collected during the current fiscal year).
1. The required budget information shall be presented in the following form:
   1. A numerical table, the columns of which shall represent the organization’s detailed budget proposed for the following fiscal year, the original detailed budget for the current fiscal year, the most recently modified budget for the current fiscal year (if it differs from the original budget), the actual expenditures for the current fiscal year to date, and an estimate of expenditures for the remainder of the current fiscal year. Each row of the table shall represent one particular income or expenditure line item from the organization’s detailed budget, and the appropriate entries shall be made for that line item under each of the column headings. For line items which apply only to the budget for the current fiscal year or the proposed budget for the following fiscal year, the entries under the columns referring to the year to which they do not apply shall be zeros. Line items may represent either types of expenditures or specific programs.
   2. A narrative text, which shall describe each line item and may contain more detailed information supporting the amounts of the proposed line items; commenting on differences between the organization’s current budget, its actual and projected expenditures for the current fiscal year, and its proposed budget for the following fiscal year; or any other information deemed relevant.
   3. An explanation of which criteria the student organization used to determine its funding population.
   4. Organizations which receive at least half of their expected income from non-Special Fee sources shall have the option of dividing their budget into Special Fee funded and non-Special Fee funded portions.
1. Any student organization seeking a Special Fee must provide complete disclosure of the following information to the Association legislative bodies:
   1.  assets
   2. reserves
   3. authorized and unauthorized non-ASSU bank accounts 
   4. ASSU bank accounts, except where prohibited by the Constitution, 
   5. sources of funding other than Special and General Fees, including but not limited to, alumni donations, corporate donations, grants, funding from other University units, endowment payouts.
1. Any student organization seeking and receiving approval from the relevant Association legislative bodies for its Special Fee request must use the same detailed budget as was approved by the relevant Association legislative bodies on its petitions.
2. All expenditures must be for the organizational and basic programming expenses of the student organization requesting the Special Fee. This student organization shall be responsible for the spending of all funds, including those used in a co-sponsored event.
3. The Commission shall determine if any given budget meets these requirements. Before making such a determination, the Elections Commission shall seek the advice of the designee(s) of the relevant Association legislative bodies and the Financial Manager concerning all Special Fee budgets that have not previously been approved by the relevant Association legislative bodies for placement on the ballot. Only if these requirements are met may a Special Fee request be place on the ballot. However, the budget of any Special Fee request which has been approved for placement on the ballot by an appropriate action of the relevant Association legislative bodies shall be considered to have met these requirements.
4. Any student organization seeking placement on the ballot of a Special Fee request on the basis of a previous Special Fee request as specified in the Constitution must satisfy the following requirement: the gross amount requested may not exceed the gross amount received in the organization’s most recent Special Fee request, as adjusted for inflation, plus ten per cent.
5. No Special Fee request shall be placed on the ballot except in accordance with the provisions of Article V, Section 2 of the Constitution, and unless its budget meets all specifications detailed above. No Special Fee request whose placement on the ballot requires the submission of petitions shall be placed on the ballot unless the petitions submitted meet all of the above requirements. If a group petitions successfully to be placed on the ballot the elections commission must notify the relevant legislative bodies within 24 hours of presentation of the petition and inform them on their constitutional right to place a note on the ballot, as outlined in the constitution Article V, Section 2.A.6.e.
6. In the event that a student organization's Special Fee request requires the approval of both Association legislative bodies in order to be placed on the ballot, but only receives the approval of one, that student organization may resubmit a revised budget to the Association legislative body that had not approved its initial request. Any petitions circulated in support of the initial Special Fee request shall remain valid despite the potentially changed budget, provided that the initial petitions were found to be valid.
7. Division of a Special Fee Request
   1. All budgetary and other financial information required for a Special Fee request to be placed on the ballot shall be presented by the student organization requesting the Special Fee to the Elections Commission, the Financial Manager, and the relevant Association legislative bodies at least 2 weeks before the last regularly scheduled meeting during Winter Quarter.
   2. Prior to this deadline, the budgetary and other financial information may be altered by the student organization requesting the Special Fee by so notifying the Elections Commission, the Financial Manager, and the relevant Association legislative bodies. After this deadline, the budgetary and other financial information may not be altered except with the consent of the relevant Association legislative bodies or of their designee(s).
   3. The relevant Association legislative bodies may divide a Special Fee request at any time after this budgetary and other financial information has been presented. The student organization requesting the Special Fee shall be given at least 48 hours prior notice that such a motion may be introduced, and the sponsor of the Special Fee (or her/his designee) shall be allowed to speak before the relevant Association legislative bodies on this issue.
   4. The mechanism by which each Association legislative body divides a Special Fee request shall be specified in the By-Laws of that body.
   5. If both Association legislative bodies divide a student organization's Special Fee request, but the divisions are not coincidental, then each ballot shall reflect the set of divisions by the relevant Association legislative bodies.
   6. The Elections Commission shall consider valid those petitions for a Special Fee request, regardless of whether the petitions reflect the division of the relevant Association legislative bodies.
   7. If not all of the sections of the divided Special Fee request are approved, then the relevant Association legislative bodies and the student organization requesting the Special Fee may agree to whatever budget modifications are necessary to provide for the support of essential administrative functions of the student organization whose absence would prevent the implementation of the activities specified in the approved section’s proposed budget.
F. General Fee Issues
Each existing undergraduate General Fee will automatically have the options for setting its amount placed on the ballot, regardless of whether a declaration of intent was filed.
G. Ballot Measures
1. The relevant Association legislative bodies may transmit to the Commission any bill or resolution to be placed on the ballot as a ballot measure, in which case the author of the bill or resolution shall be considered the author of the ballot measure.
2. Any member of the Association seeking to place a ballot measure on the ballot must submit a petition of members of the relevant population of the Association to the Commission. The information pages in each petition packet shall contain the text of the ballot measure, as well as the population to which the ballot measure is addressed.

The Election Commission may choose to publish the Handbook solely in electronic form, as long as its availability is widely publicized. Separate election handbooks may be published for the graduate and undergraduate populations containing only the information relevant to each population, but each must contain information on how to obtain the other handbook.
