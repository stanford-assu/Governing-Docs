    divisions of SSE that are not business enterprises, such as SSE Capital
    Group; and third, to provide a common forum for persons involved or
    interested in the operations of the ASSU to discuss future strategies and
    initiatives.

    forwarded to cognizant persons (e.g. the SSE Board of Directors, the ASSU

    <strong>Appendix A. Narrative: Why we’re creating the FMAC</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The FMAC has been created to centralize oversight and advice for the ASSU’s
    operations (especially fiscal operations), in recognition of the fact that
    the job of the ASSU Financial Manager typically involves calling disjointed
    meetings with all the parties impacted by the ASSU’s operations. Over the
    years, we’ve noticed that keeping all involved parties “in the loop” is
    challenging, and leads to a fragmented ASSU because everybody naturally
    gets a different understanding of our goals and status.
</p>
<p>
    It is our hope that the creation of the FMAC will allow the ASSU to move
    forward with a unified vision, broad support for new and old initiatives,
    and a deeper understanding of its own operations. The ASSU legislative
    bodies can benefit from meaningful interaction with the operations branches
    of the ASSU; the Board can benefit from a stronger understanding of the
    goals and status of the ASSU; and recognizing the role that the University
    holds in advising the ASSU will be beneficial for all parties.
</p>
<p>
    The membership of this Advisory Committee is extraordinarily malleable for
    a reason: it has been our experience that some of the best and most
    interested student leaders in the ASSU do not necessarily hold a high role
    in the organization. It is specifically the purpose of the FMAC to
    centralize all the ASSU leaders in one room to let them discuss issues of
    critical importance. If the FM and Chair of the Board both believe that a
    student would be a benefit to the organization, he or she should be added
    to the Board to cement his/her participation and provide critical
    perspective.
</p>
<p>
    The openness of information about the ASSU is of paramount importance to
    the future of the organization. Wherever possible, the FMAC should release
    its agenda and minutes publicly. The FMAC should consider the “Freedom of
    Information” clause of the ASSU Constitution and only consider confidential
    those portions of its minutes that contain:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        financial records for non-funded accounts of organizations banking with
    the Association
    </li>
    <li>
        financial records for non-funded accounts of organizations banking with
        the Association
    </li>
    <li>
        Legal Counseling records
    </li>
    <li>
        personnel records of employees <em>(Constitution Article I, §7.1)</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Specifically, the FMAC should not release information about deliberations
    for the performance-based bonus for the FM, hiring decisions, contract
negotiations, or the performance of any employee. Importantly, the FMAC    <em>should </em>release its deliberations about all aspects of the ASSU’s
    fiscal health; such records <em>are not</em> proprietary business
    information.
