A bill in support or opposition of a position shall be a resolution. Its purpose is to voice the US’s support of a particular cause. This section of these By-Laws governs the consideration of these resolutions, which may or may not be controversial in nature.
B. Text of Resolutions
All resolutions must include the following information in the resolution’s text about the subject of the endorsement:
1. Constitutionality: the resolution must explain how it complies with Article I, Section 5 of the Association Constitution. Specifically, it must show that the issue has a direct effect on at least one Stanford student who is affected by the matter in a substantially different manner than would be the case if they were not a university student, as defined in the Constitution. To meet this requirement, it will suffice to only direct the statement to other elements of the University.
2. Relevance: Resolutions should also demonstrate why the issue is being presented at the present time – whether it is part of a campaign by a student group, if the administration is close to making an important decision, if an event is requesting endorsement from the Association, etc.
3. Background: The resolution’s authors shall include background information about the issue at hand, such as how the issue has arisen, the history of the issue at Stanford (including actions of the administration, student groups, and the Association), and/or facts or statistics surrounding the issue. If background information is too long to be included within the resolution, it can be submitted as a separate document so long as it is present for voting and prior notification.
4. Argument: The resolution’s authors must argue on behalf of the resolution within the text by stating the advantages of the position under consideration and address potential criticisms of the resolution.
5. Authorization: The resolution must authorize action to make use of Association resources on behalf of the endorsed cause. The resolution must specifically explain who is authorized to act, how, and under what circumstances. If a resolution is intended to authorize an indefinite amount of activity in the future, the resolution must say so along with whatever limitations on the activity, the circumstances of its undertaking, or the identity of its undertakers.
C. Prior Notification
1. The full text of resolutions must be presented to the US at least one week in advance of the vote on the bill. This includes the background material, as required by Article I, Section 5, Subsection B.1) if it is not explicitly included in the resolution.
2. Congratulatory Resolutions, defined as resolutions that honor the achievements of individuals or groups that the US believes has impacted or will impact the interests of the members of the Association, shall be exempted from the prior notification requirements.

Appendix I: Election Policies
Section 1: General
These Policies shall apply only to those candidates, slates, Annual Grants requests, and sponsors whose election issues can be voted upon exclusively by members of the undergraduate population.
Section 2: Candidates
A. Members of the US
1. Any members of the undergraduate population declaring intent to become a member of the US, and requesting to appear in the Elections Handbook and on the ballot, must submit to the Elections Commission a petition of at least 100 members of the undergraduate population.
2. The Senate may unanimously vote to send any upperclass candidate (designated as such in the Elections Handbook), to the Elections Commission to have their status as an upperclass candidate reviewed. The Elections Commission will then have the authority to remove the designation of “upperclass candidate” as defined in Article II, Section 3.A.3 of the ASSU Constitution.
3. Candidates who do not meet the definition of “upperclass candidate” in Article II, Section 3.A.3 of the ASSU Constitution may not petition the Elections Commission to be designated as upperclass candidates. Disputes regarding the definition of “upperclass candidate” shall be resolved by the ASSU Constitutional Council.
4. If the Elections Commission removes the designation of upperclass candidate, the candidate in question is still eligible to run as an at-large candidate, but cannot be treated as an upperclass candidate for the purposes of Article II Section 3.A of the ASSU Constitution, regardless of their academic status as defined by the University Registrar.
B. Class Presidents
1. Any members of the undergraduate population declaring intent to become Class Presidents, and requesting to appear in the Elections Handbook and on the ballot, must submit to the Elections Commission a petition of at least 100 members of the undergraduate population.
2. There shall be Sophomore, Junior, and Senior Class Presidents. The Class Presidents will be elected during the Spring General Election. Students may vote for the Class Presidents for only one class, and candidates for Sophomore and Senior Class Presidents shall be slates of four people. Slates for Junior Class Presidents may have up to six people, on the condition that at least four of them are present on campus at any given time during the term of office.
3. To the extent that it is possible, the only students who will run or vote for a given Class President slate will be students in the class immediately below (i.e. only freshmen will run or vote for Sophomore Class Presidents). Because it may not be possible to accurately determine the class to which a given student belongs, the Elections Commission shall err on the side of allowing students to declare what class they belong to. For the purposes of this subsection, a student's class shall be the one which they identify themselves with socially, which may or may not be the same as the class status assigned to them by the University Registrar.
4. Instant Runoff Voting (hereafter “IRV”) shall be used in elections for Class Presidents as defined by the following procedure:
   1. Should a slate receive a majority of the vote, the US shall certify the election of that slate.
   2. Should no slate receive a majority of the vote, there shall be successive IRV rounds using the rankings on voters’ ballots cast in a General Election.
   3. In each IRV round, the highest-ranked valid votes on voters’ ballots shall be tallied, and the slate with the fewest votes shall be eliminated. Votes for that slate shall not be considered valid in subsequent rounds. If no valid choice is indicated on a ballot, then that ballot shall be removed from subsequent tallies.
   4. IRV rounds shall be repeated until one slate remains. The US shall certify the election of that slate as the Class Presidents.
1. If resolution of a tie vote is necessary to determine the slate to be eliminated in a given round of the instant runoff, the tie shall be resolved by eliminating the tied slate that had the fewest votes in successively previous rounds until the tie is resolved or all previous rounds have been considered. If the tie cannot be resolved by this method, it shall be resolved by utilizing the same procedure specified for resolving US ties.
Section 3: US Oath of Office
The following shall be the oath of office for the members of the US:
“I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the duties of the office of Undergraduate Senator of the Associated Students of Stanford University; that I take this obligation freely; that I will advocate for and serve the interests of the entire undergraduate population; and that I will uphold the Constitution of the Associated Students of Stanford University.”

A. General
This section is intended to clarify the process for administering unspent funding from the Undergraduate Fee, and as such it also appears verbatim in the Fee Statement for the Undergraduate Fee. This section shall be changed if the Fee Statement is altered, as the Fee Statement takes precedence over these By-Laws.
It is the intent of the undergraduate students of Stanford University to rein in the long-term growth of groups’ reserve funds. To balance this goal with the diverse reasons for groups to have retained reserve funds historically, all unspent funding allocated to a group in a given year through Annual Grants shall be taxed, unless otherwise exempted by the Undergraduate Senate. The remaining unspent funding that is not taxed shall be added to that individual group’s reserve account, if one currently exists. All unspent funding allocated to a group in a given year through Standard or Quick Grants will be automatically added to the allocable amount for the next year at the close of the fiscal year.

C. Exemption from the Tax on Unspent Funding
1. The Undergraduate Senate shall have the power to exempt groups from the Tax on Unspent Funding.
2. A group may apply for an exemption for one of the following reasons:
   1. Holding reserves to pay for up-front costs that are not covered entirely by other ASSU funding sources
   2. Extenuating circumstances that necessitate additional funds being held untaxed into the following fiscal year. Extenuating circumstances shall be discretionarily defined by the Financial Manager. The Undergraduate Senate may overrule.
1. To request an exemption, a group shall submit a request to the Senate Appropriations Committee detailing, among other things:
   1. The reason they need an exemption
   2. The anticipated balance of their reserve account throughout the year
   3. The group’s requested maximum reserve amount
1. An exemption may be approved by a 2/3 vote of the Undergraduate Senate.
2. Every two years, the Appropriations Committee shall review the size and use of a group’s reserve during
