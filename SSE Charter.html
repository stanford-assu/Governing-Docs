The purposes of the Company are: (i) to manage the financial assets and business enterprises of the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) and its affiliates in an effective and professional manner (ii) to recruit and retain the best possible leadership and professional staff for such management activities, and (iii) to engage a Board of Directors composed of persons with appropriate business and management skills in support of such objectives.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>2.2 </span><span class="c0">General Authority</span><span class="c1">. The Company is authorized and empowered, on behalf of the ASSU, to enter into contracts, make investments and perform all related business functions in accordance with this Charter and in conformity with all policies and guidelines adopted by the ASSU and the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors. The Company&rsquo;s management shall not take nor authorize the taking of any action not contemplated by this Charter, unless specifically approved by resolution of the Board of Directors or ASSU.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">ARTICLE 3</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">BOARD OF DIRECTORS</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.1 </span><span class="c0">Powers</span><span class="c1">. The activities and affairs of the Company shall be conducted, and all its powers shall be exercised, by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Subject to the provisions of this Charter, the Board of Directors may delegate the management of the activities of the Company to any person or persons, management company or committee, however composed, provided that the activities and affairs of the Company shall be managed and all its powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the Board of Directors.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.2 </span><span class="c0">Appointment and Number</span><span>. The members of the SSE Board of Directors (individually a &ldquo;Director&rdquo; and, collectively, the &ldquo;Directors&rdquo;) shall have two categories of Directors: current Stanford students and non-student directors comprised of a minimum of three University administrators and a minimum of three external community members. &nbsp;The number of Directors shall be determined by the Board of Directors, but shall be no more than fifteen with up to seven student directors and up to eight non-student directors. The Directors may be recommended by the ASSU President, Graduate Student Council, Undergraduate Senate, ASSU Nominations Commission, Governance Committee, or a Director; are formally vetted and nominated to the Board by the Governance Committee; and are subject to final approval by a quorum of the Board of Directors. Four of the student positions shall be filled by the ASSU President, Undergraduate Senate Chair, Graduate Student Council Chair, and SSE Investments Analyst or equivalent as determined by the FM/CEO. &nbsp;The remaining student positions can be undergraduate or graduate &ldquo;at large&rdquo; students. The ASSU President may allow the ASSU Vice President to act as their proxy.

Such Directors shall cease to be Directors upon termination of such employment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.4 </span><span class="c0">Fiduciary Duty</span><span class="c1">. Each Director shall act as a fiduciary of the ASSU and shall perform all of such Director&#39;s duties in good faith, in a manner such Director believes to be in the best interests of the ASSU, and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.5 </span><span class="c0">Avoidance of Conflict of Interest</span><span class="c1">. In light of the investment discretion delegated to the Company, and in order to avoid any possible conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest, any Director aware of a material financial interest he or she has in any transaction in which the Company has or will take part, immediately upon becoming aware of such interest, shall disclose such interest to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors shall take such other action, if any, as may be warranted. Such Director&#39;s vote will not be counted in any vote taken by the Board of Directors relating to such transaction.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.6 </span><span class="c0">Compensation</span><span class="c1">. The Directors shall serve without compensation except that University administrators may be compensated by the University for the time spent performing duties for the Company.

Due notice of all meetings of the Board of Directors shall be sent to each Director by mail, telegraph, fax, or telephone. The sending of a notice by mail not less than ninety-six hours before, or by telegram, fax or telephone not less than twenty-four hours before any meeting shall be sufficient notice of such meeting. Notice shall be given to each Director at the address specified by such Director.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.12 </span><span class="c0">Quorum</span><span class="c1">. A majority of the approved number of Directors shall constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of the Directors present may take any action, except when a larger vote is required by this Charter or by action of the ASSU.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.13 </span><span class="c0">Telephonic Meetings</span><span class="c1">. The Directors may participate in meetings of the Directors or committees of the Directors by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment which enables all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other.

If the Chair and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the &ldquo;CEO&rdquo;) determine that action of the Board of Directors is required before its next regular meeting, then the following, when in unanimous agreement, shall have and exercise the power of the Board of Directors in all matters: the Chair, the CEO and any two other Directors, at least one of whom shall be a student. Any action taken under these procedures shall be reported to, and approved by, the Board of Directors at its next regular meeting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.16 </span><span class="c0">Adjournment of Meetings</span><span class="c1">. Any meeting of the Board of Directors, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned to another time and place by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors present. If the meeting is adjourned for more than twenty-four hours, notice of such adjournment to another time and place shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to the Directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.17 </span><span class="c0">Organization of Meetings</span><span class="c1">. The Chair of the Board of Directors, if present shall preside at every meeting of the Board of Directors. If the Chair is not present, a Director chosen by a majority of the Directors present shall act as Chair. The Secretary of the Company or, in the absence of the Secretary, any person appointed by the Chair shall act as secretary of the meeting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>3.18 </span><span class="c0">Committees</span><span class="c1">. The Board of Directors may establish such committees whether special or standing, as may be determined by the Board of Directors.
