Article I: General
Section 1: Philosophy of the Graduate Student Council
1. The Graduate Student Council shall serve the interests and advocate on behalf of the graduate population. The Graduate Student Council shall also organize programming for, and encourage the development  of, the graduate community. Because the input  and viewpoints  of all members of the graduate population are important, the GSC shall make  all  decisions by  consensus, unless otherwise specified in the Constitution, the Association By-Laws and Policies, or these By-Laws. 
Section 2: Definitions
1. The GSC shall refer to the Graduate Student Council.
2. The graduate population shall be all members of the Association in graduate or professional degree programs.
3. The elected members of the GSC shall be those who were selected in either a special or general Association election.
4. The appointed members of the GSC shall be those who were chosen, in accordance with the Constitution and these By-Laws, to fill vacant GSC seats.
5. The voting members of the GSC shall be those who are eligible to vote in the votes mandated in the Constitution, the Association By-Laws, or these By-Laws. It shall encompass both the elected and appointed members of the GSC.
6. The members of the GSC shall be the elected members and the appointed members, and all other members of the graduate population present at a GSC meeting.
7. A seat on the GSC shall be considered vacant if the individual occupying it has resigned, ceased to be a member of the district to which the seat corresponds, been expelled from the GSC, or died.
8. Majority for the purposes of the GSC regardless  of source document, shall always require more votes for than against. Therefore, a tie will cause a motion to fail.
9. Unless otherwise specified, a vote of the GSC shall be a vote by the voting members of the GSC only.
10. A graduate student organization or GSO shall refer to any  student organization whose membership and/or audience is drawn substantially from the graduate population, with the exception of the GSC.
Section 3: GSC Policies
1. The GSC Policies shall contain the details of the organizational structure of the GSC. They shall contain information sufficiently important to require some form of GSC approval to change, but sufficiently malleable that the rigidity of the GSC Bylaws modification procedure would be inappropriate.
2. The GSC Policies shall govern in all cases where they are applicable, and in which they are not inconsistent with the Constitution, the Association Bylaws, these Bylaws, or the Association Policies.
3. The GSC Policies shall be included as an Appendix to these Bylaws.
4. The GSC Policies may be modified by consensus of the members  of the GSC. In the event  that consensus cannot be reached, a majority of GSC's voting members is  required to modify GSC policy.
Section 4: Rules of Order
1. The Chair (or her/his  designee)  shall be responsible for ensuring that the meetings are run in  a fair and efficient manner. The voting members of the GSC may overrule any particular decision of the Chair (or her/his designee) in this regard by majority vote.
A. Voting Procedures
1. Quorum consists of a majority of the non-vacant GSC seats, and  must be present for any  GSC business to occur.
2. Ex-officio members are not counted towards quorum and are not given a vote.
3. Unless otherwise specified in the Constitution, the Association Bylaws, or these Bylaws, each decision of the GSC shall be made by the consensus of those members of the graduate population present at the meeting during which the decision was made.
4. Consensus cannot be reached if any GSC member objects.
5. In the event that consensus cannot be reached, the procedure shall be a majority vote by the voting members present.
6. Abstentions are not counted for the purposes of determining the result of a vote, and as such are not de facto "no" votes.
C.

C.  
1. Applications shall be kept on file and made available by the Financial Officer.
Section 2: Review Procedure
A.
1. Groups applying for GSO partition funds will be notified of the time and location of all relevant meetings at least 48 hours in advance. If either the Funding Committee or the GSC fails to meet  the requirement and the group is not able to send a representative to the meeting as a result, the group may, within one week, request that their application be re-evaluated at a time when a member of their organization is able to attend.
B.
1. The Funding Committee shall consider the answers to the following questions  when formulating its judgement of an application:
   1. What is the target population for the organization and its activities?
   2. How will the organization's activities be advertised?
   3. How realistic and specific are the activities and budget figures?
   4. Is the allocation a fair and efficient use of the GSO partition?
   5. If applicable, have the organization's previous funded and  non-funded events been successful?
   6. Does the organization's activities provide sufficient value for the amount of money allocated?
   7. Does the organization's activities make a unique contribution to the community?
C. 
1. The GSC has set the following policies regarding specific types of funding:
   1. Courses offered for credit: Courses offered for credit in a department should, in general, be funded by that  department. The GSC realizes, however, that departments are  sometimes reluctant to fund a new course. Because of this, the GSC may partially fund a new course for up to two (2) academic years. After that time, it is expected that the department  will take over funding the course.
   2. Conferences: The GSC may help  subsidize conference registrations  for conferences  if such a conference is significantly related to an organization's activities. This will be limited to $50 per person for up to six (6) people for conference registration.
   3. Travel: The GSC has set a standard mileage rate of $0.25 per  mile for up to $5 per  person. For conferences, the six (6) person limit applies.
   4. Funding for regular group activities: The GSC understands the importance of having regular, consistent meetings for organizations. However, the GSC will  not provide  funds  for regular group meeting expenses, including space rental, food, and other meeting costs.
   5. Events held off-campus: There is a significant concern that off-campus events are, by their nature, limited in appeal and scope. The GSC does not generally fund such events, except in the cases where they are: (a) easily accessible by the graduate student community, and (b) appropriate facilities are not available on campus. These exceptions  are made at the discretion  of the funding committee. In no case will the GSC fund off-campus recreational activities.
   6. Advertising events using flyers and newspaper ads: The GSC does not generally provide funding for flyers and newspaper ads. Groups are instead required to post their event to the GSC-events email list, and encouraged to contact the Stanford Daily to see if they will cover the event.
   7. Seed funding: In recognition of the need to encourage more graduate student involvement is GSOs, the GSC may  provide seed funding  to cover a significant  portion of a group's expenses  in its first year of operation. After that, the group should attempt to diversify their  funding  sources, as the GSC is likely to reduce its level of support, depending on  budgetary considerations and the availability of alternative funding.
   8. Community service events: Community service, for the purpose of GSC funding, is defined as an activity or event in which Stanford students work together to promote community, learning, health, or social well-being for themselves and for others. The GSC will consider funding community service events and activities of GSOs through the regular funding process provided that:
      1. the service work takes place on campus or in the San Francisco Bay  Area, and
      2. funds are used in a way that encourages the involvement and enrichment of the participating Stanford graduate students.
   1. Inclusiveness: In  funding  GSO events or activities-including, but not limited to those that may have religious or political overtones-the GSC seeks to promote cultural understanding and the free exchange of diverse viewpoints. With this in mind, GSOs seeking event funding should demonstrate a concerted effort to welcome and promote the participation of diverse segments of the graduate student community. Events and activities involving politically charged issues should focus on the education of the general community regarding the history and relevance of the issue. The GSC will not fund events or activities that:
      1. have any appearance or tone of exclusivity,
      2. create an environment where a given segment of the graduate student population are made to feel unwelcome at the event due to religious, political, or other conviction,
      3. require prayer or involve campaigning.
D. 
1. The Committee shall prepare a brief recommendation to the GSC regarding each proposal. At the first GSC meeting after preparation of the recommendation,  the Committee shall summarize the application and present its recommendation.
Section 3: Terms and Conditions for Use of Funds
A.  
1. The Financial Manager shall notify an organization when funds become available to it.
B.   
1. The Financial Manager may, at his/her discretion, grant extensions to the ending date of an allocation to ensure that all transactions are cleared. No extension may  be granted beyond the end of the fiscal year to which the allocation applies.
C.
1. Unless otherwise specified by the GSC, title to all tangible property purchased, in whole or in part, through the use of funds from the GSGF shall vest with the ASSU, and possession shall devolve upon the ASSU in the event of the dissolution of the GSO possessing the property.
D.  
1. A GSO shall be considered to be dissolved upon the receipt of a declaration of dissolution by its membership, failure to register with the Office of Student Activities for 15 months, or after a declaration of dissolution by the GSC following reasonable efforts to contact the last known officers of the GSO. All allocations to a GSO shall end upon dissolution of that GSO.
E.   
1. Advertisements for events funded by the GSGF shall cite the GSC as a sponsor  or cosponsor.
F.
