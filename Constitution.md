    2. Preamble
        We, the students of Stanford University, in order to advance our interests, define our responsibilities and to provide for our meaningful participation in the governance of the University, do hereby associate and establish this Constitution. Having received the acceptance of the University and the Board of Trustees, this Constitution shall be respected by University officials, faculty and staff in their dealings with students of the University.
2. Name, Scope, Membership, and Independence
    1. Name
        The name of the organization under this Constitution shall be the Associated Students of Stanford University, hereafter referred to as the “Association.”

        2. The following population subsets of the Association shall be defined:
            1. Undergraduate population: All undergraduate members of the Association
            2. Graduate population: All graduate and professional school members of the Association
            3. Association population: All members of the Association
    3. Rights of Membership
        1. All members of the Association shall also be liable for such fees as this Association may assess. However, all members shall have the right to a full refund of any and all fees paid to the Association.
        2. The Association shall enact no legislation respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Association for a redress of grievances.
        3. All members of the Association have the right to attend all open meetings of the Association and to view all open records of the Association.
        4. The final authority of the Association shall in perpetuity be vested in the members of the Association—the students of Stanford University.
    4. Rights of the Accused
        An accused member of the Association shall have the following rights. Any judicial body hearing a case against that person shall inform her or him of his or her rights guaranteed under this section at the time she or he is notified of the charges against him or her.
        1. To be informed of all the charges and the alleged acts upon which those charges are based.
        2. To be allowed a reasonable time in which to prepare a defense.
        3. To hear all evidence upon which charges are based, and to answer this evidence through rebuttal.
        4. To call witnesses before the judicial body and to confront any other witnesses before the judicial body.
        5. To be assured that, unless the defendant asks for an open hearing, any matters of facts which would tend to identify the person or persons involved in a case would be kept confidential.
        6. To have an open hearing.

This limitation shall not apply when the judicial body’s proceedings are deemed necessary by the judicial body to protect the University community from risk or harm. Nothing in this paragraph, however, shall be interpreted as barring or delaying action by the judicial body on a case because a similar charge is pending before a civil court.
    5. Representation and Accountability
        This Association shall be the sole representative of the entire Stanford student body.
        1. Within the University
            Only this Association and its designees shall represent the entire Stanford student body, or a population of the Association, in any dealings with other elements of the University.

            1. [The body must discuss the appointment, the employment, the performance, or the dismissal of an Association member or employee who is neither the President, the Vice President, nor a member of an Association legislative body.][3]

    1. General Fees
        1. General
            The Association may levy one or more General Fees upon its graduate student membership. Each General Fee must have an explicit statement of purpose, which must be approved by the same procedure used to set the base amount for the General Fee. Funds may be disbursed from a General Fee upon the approval of the relevant legislative body, and only in accordance with the approved statement of purpose.
        2. Modification of General Fees
            1. Each General Fee levied on an Association population shall increase each year by a percentage equal to a nationally-recognized index of inflation, specified in the Association By-Laws.
            2. The Graduate Student Council may, by a 2/3 vote, place a proposal to create, abolish, or modify the base amount of a General Fee of the relevant population, or to change its statement of purpose, on the ballot of the Association Spring Quarter General Election. Only members of the relevant population shall be eligible to vote on such proposals. Proposals to modify the base amount must include the specific proposed new base amount; proposals to modify its statement of purpose must include the proposed new statement of purpose. Such a proposal will be adopted if 2/3 of the relevant population voting is in favor, and if those in favor make up 15 percent of the relevant population.
    2. Special Fees
        1. Placement on the Ballot
            1. During the Association Spring Quarter General Election, the Association may levy one or more Special Fees on the graduate student population via referenda, and may levy Joint Fees upon both populations. Graduate Special Fees may be sought by graduate student organizations to cover their organizational and basic programming expenses. Joint Fees may be sought by student organizations to cover their organizational and basic programming expenses when those expenses benefit both the graduate and undergraduate populations.
            2. Joint Fees shall be paid by graduate students as Special Fees, and by undergraduate students as Annual Grants. A Joint Fee must receive legislative approval from both the undergraduate Annual Grants process and the graduate Special Fees process, and must be approved by the Association as provided in this Article.
            3. The Graduate Student Council shall have the authority to specify the form in which the detailed budget and summary of actual expenditures must be presented and the information they must contain, and to establish regulations defining the proper form for petitions and governing the circulation thereof.
            4. No Special Fee budget may include a buffer of more than 25 percent to guard against Special Fee refunds.
            5. Student organizations that receive a Special Fee may not deprive any member of the graduate population of any or all of its services unless that member has obtained a refund of that organization’s fee. However, during a given year, a student organization may not charge a total amount greater than its per capita Special Fee for services provided to undergraduate members of the Association.
            6. A student organization shall have its request for a Special Fee placed on the ballot by any one of the following procedures:
                1. Prepare a detailed budget for the student organization for the next fiscal year, including the amount sought from the Special Fee, and submit this, along with the current budget and a summary of actual expenditures, to the Association in the form of a petition. Such petitions must bear the signatures of 15 percent of the members of each population of the Association from which the student organization is seeking a Special Fee, and request the placement of the Special Fee on the ballot for consideration by that population. Such petitions shall be presented to the Elections Commissioner, who must examine for authenticity the signatures on the petitions within seven days after receiving it. Upon verifying a petition, the Elections Commissioner shall then authorize the placement of the Special Fee on the ballot for Association consideration.
                2. Prepare a detailed budget for the student organization for the next fiscal year, including the amount sought from the Special Fee, and submit this, along with the current budget and a summary of actual expenditures, to the Graduate Student Council. This information must also be submitted to the relevant population of the Association in the form of a petition. Such petitions must bear the signatures of 10 percent of the members of each population of the Association from which the student organization is seeking a Special Fee, and request the placement of the Special Fee on the ballot for consideration by that population. Such petitions shall be presented to the Elections Commissioner, who must examine for authenticity the signatures on the petitions within seven days after receiving it. Upon verifying the petition, the Elections Commissioner shall then authorize the placement of the Special Fee on the ballot for Association consideration, provided that this request has also been approved by a 3/5 vote of the Graduate Student Council.
                3. Prepare a detailed budget for the student organization for the next fiscal year, including the amount sought from the Special Fee, and submit this, along with the current budget and a summary of actual expenditures, to the Graduate Student Council. Upon approval by a 3/5 vote of the Graduate Student Council, the Elections Commissioner shall then authorize the placement of the Special Fee on the ballot for Association consideration, provided that: 1) the last time this student organization appeared on the ballot for a Special Fee, those in favor of the Special Fee constituted a majority of the members of the Association voting on the Special Fee, and 2) the fee presently sought is not substantially higher than the fee requested the last time this student organization appeared on the ballot for a Special Fee.
            7. The relevant Association legislative bodies shall be those that represent the population from which the student organization is requesting a Special Fee. The Association By-Laws shall contain procedures for dealing with a student organization that needs approval from both Association legislative bodies for placement of its Special Fee request on the ballot, but receives approval from only one.
            8. The Graduate Student Council shall not have the power to remove a Special Fee from the ballot once one of the above procedures has been completed for that Special Fee. However, the Graduate Student Council may vote on Special Fees already approved by the Elections Commissioner for the ballot, and a notation may be included on the ballot indicating the results of such a vote on the Special Fee.
            9. One of the above procedures must be completed by a deadline specified in the Association By-Laws, but no later than 21 days before the general election. The Elections Commission shall give public notice in the largest general circulation student newspaper and/or mass distribution of flyers or through inclusion in an election pamphlet/handbook of the Special Fee requests which will appear on the ballot and their amounts at least 7 days before the general election.
        2. Placement on the Ballot in Extenuating Circumstances
            If a student organization has completed one of the above procedures within 21 days of the general election, and the Graduate Student Council determines that extenuating circumstances prevented an earlier completion of one of these procedures, then the Graduate Student Council may authorize the placement of a Special Fee on the ballot for Association consideration. This authorization shall be by a procedure specified in the Graduate Student Council's By-Laws. In this case within two days after authorization, the Elections Commission shall give public notice in the largest general circulation student newspaper and/or mass distribution of flyers or through the inclusion in an election handbook of the Special Fee(s) and their amount(s) to be placed on the ballot for student consideration.
        3. Financial Information
            During the general election a summary of all financial information submitted by the student organization seeking a Special Fee shall be made available to all graduate members of the Association
        4. Division of Special Fee Requests
            Regardless of which procedure for placement of a Special Fee request on the ballot was followed, the detailed budget for the next fiscal year of a student organization seeking a Special Fee may be divided into two sections by each of the Graduate Student Council. These sections may consist of, but are not limited to, line-items, events, or populations. This shall be authorized by a procedure specified in the Graduate Student Council's By-Laws. The Graduate Student Council’s By-Laws shall deal with those cases in which the two partitions do not coincide. Each section, along with an appropriate amount sought from the student organization’s initial Special Fee request, its current budget, and the summary of actual expenditures to date, shall be considered as a separate and independent Special Fee request, shall appear separately on the ballot, and shall require separate approval by the members of the Association as provided herein. The sum of the partitioned Special Fee requests appearing on the ballot shall equal the amount sought in the organization’s initial Special Fee request.
        5. Approval by the Association
            1. Graduate and Professional School members of the Association shall be eligible to vote on each Special Fee for which the student organization in question is seeking funding either from the graduate population.
            2. During the general election, each graduate member of the Association may cast one vote either in favor or in opposition to each Special Fee for which he is eligible.
            3. A Special Fee shall be deemed to have passed if a majority of those voting on it from each of the relevant populations were in favor and if those in favor constituted at least 15 per cent of those members of the Association eligible to vote on that Special Fee.
        [Deleted Section F. Approval of the University] [See note at [15]]
    3. Collection of the General and Special Fees
        1. Collection Schedule
            After the Association Spring Quarter General Election results have been certified by the Graduate Student Council, the Financial Manager shall devise and submit to the relevant Association legislative bodies, for approval, a schedule for the levying of the General and Special Fees levied on their respective populations. This collection schedule must conform to the following five principles:
            1. The amount levied during each of Autumn, Winter, and Spring quarters shall be substantially the same. The graduate population may have a fee levied on it during the Summer quarter.
            2. The amount levied each quarter shall be an integral amount of dollars.
            3. The amount levied each quarter shall be apportioned among the General and Special Fees in a manner that shall provide an adequate cash flow for the concerned student organizations.
            4. All costs incurred by the Association in administering the approval, disbursement, and refund processes, and in enforcing compliance by the recipients of such funds with their authorized budgets, along with an appropriate portion of the general election costs, shall be paid by a surcharge levied on the authorized General and Special Fees. This surcharge shall be a uniform percentage of each Fee.
            5. General and Special Fees may only be levied on members of graduate population of the Association.
        2. Collection of Fees
            The University shall collect the appropriate amount every quarter at the same time it collects charges for tuition. The University shall transfer all collected monies to the Financial Manager, who shall then distribute them into the appropriate financial accounts.
    4. Refund of the General and Special Fees
        1. Any member of the graduate population shall be entitled to a refund of at least the amount assessed in support of the entire, or any portion of, any General or Special Fee. This amount shall be specified in the collection schedule for the Fees, and should be as close as practical to the actual per capita amount collected for the Fee in question.
        2. Obtaining this refund may deprive the member of the Association of some or all of the services offered by the student organizations receiving these monies.
    5. Distribution of the General and Special Fees
        1. Distribution of General and Special Fees
            The By-Laws of the Graduate Student Council shall govern the distribution of the General and Special Fees. The Graduate Student Council shall retain ultimate authority over the distribution of General and Special Fees.
        2. Deviations from Special Fee Budgets
            The Financial Manager shall notify the Graduate Student Council whenever a student organization who has obtained a Special Fee significantly deviates from its budget. The Graduate Student Council may then direct the Financial Manager to halt any distribution of funds from the concerned student organization’s account that would force it outside of its budget.
        3. Modifications of Special Fee Budgets
            Any student organization who has obtained a Special Fee may modify its budget, subject to the approval of the Financial Manager. The relevant Association legislative bodies shall retain ultimate authority over the approval of such modifications.
        4. Reserve Funds
            1. If the total amount spent from a General or Special Fee is less than was allocated, then the Financial Manager shall transfer the remaining funds into a Reserve Account for that fee.
            2. The Financial Manager may distribute funds from the Reserve Account of a group to that group upon authorization by the Graduate Student Council. This shall be authorized by a procedure specified in the Graduate Student Council's By-Laws.
7. Undergraduate Finances
    1. Fees due to the Association
        1. General
            1. It is the intent of the undergraduate students of Stanford University that the previous system of General Fees and Special Fees is abolished for the undergraduate population, and replaced with the system described in this Article.
            2. The Association may levy one or more fees upon the undergraduate population. These fees shall be known collectively as the Undergraduate Student Activities Fees. In this section, the term “fees” shall be construed to mean only these Undergraduate Student Activities Fees.
            3. Undergraduate members of the Association shall not be liable for any fees detailed in Article V of the Constitution, except where detailed.
            4. This article shall not affect funds derived under Article V of the Constitution.

            6. Funds derived from fees shall be expended only according to the By-laws of the relevant Association legislative bodies, and the Fee Statement of each fee.
            7. Where Article V and Article VI conflict, the Constitutional Council shall have the power to determine which section takes precedence. The Constitutional Council shall take into account the intent of the undergraduate population in enacting this section, as well as the necessity of maintaining financial stability across the entire Association. The decision of the Constitutional Council shall be binding until and unless the decision is moot because of a Constitutional amendment.
        2. Definition of each Undergraduate Student Activities Fee
            1. An Undergraduate Student Activities Fee shall have a base amount and a well-defined population upon which it is levied, typically the entire undergraduate population. The Undergraduate Senate shall be the relevant legislative body and shall have sole oversight of that fee.
            2. Each Undergraduate Student Activities Fee shall have a Fee Statement that governs how the fee shall be disbursed. Such Fee Statements shall be subordinate to this Constitution, but shall take precedence over the Association By-Laws. Each Fee Statement shall be placed as an appendix to this Constitution.
            3. The Undergraduate Senate may, by a 2/3 vote, place a proposal to create a fee, abolish a fee, modify the base amount of a fee, modify the population upon which a fee is charged, or change the Fee Statement of a fee on the ballot of the Association Spring Quarter General Election.
                1. All such proposals shall be placed on the ballot of the Association Spring Quarter General Election, and only members of the relevant population shall be eligible to vote on such proposals. Where a proposal is to change the population of a Fee, the relevant population shall be the proposed new population.
                2. Such proposals shall be as specific as practical; proposals to modify any existing element of the fee shall explicitly enumerate both the existing and proposed element.
                3. Such a proposal will be adopted if 2/3 of the relevant population voting is in favor, and if those in favor make up 15 percent of the relevant population.
        3. Management of Undergraduate Student Activities Fees
            1. All funds derived from an Undergraduate Student Activities Fee shall be subject to the freedom of information requirements of the Association.
            2. All costs incurred by the Association in administering the approval, disbursement, and waiver processes, and in enforcing compliance by the recipients of funds derived from a fee, shall be paid by an administrative surcharge subtracted from the net amount received from that fee. The money remaining after subtracting the administrative surcharge shall be the allocable amount.
            3. Funds shall only be allocated to organizations that Voluntary Student Organizations, Chartered Student Organizations, or recognized divisions of the Association.
                1. Voluntary Student Organizations are defined as organizations which are composed predominantly or exclusively of members of the Association, require no student to join, are recognized by the University, and are either open to all students or open to only those students meeting certain criteria which are established and evaluated in an objective manner by the organization. In order to qualify under this provision, the ultimate constitutional, budgetary, and policy-making authority of the organization must be vested entirely in its student members, except in the case of a specific exemption granted by the University and the Association.
                2. Chartered Organizations are defined as organizations which are composed predominantly or exclusively of members of the Association, require no student to join, are recognized by the University, and are either open to all students or open to only those students meeting certain criteria which are established and evaluated in an objective manner by the organization, but where the ultimate constitutional, budgetary, and policy-making authority are vested in a University office or committee or any body other than its student membership.
                3. Divisions of the Association are defined as anybody that is named in a written governing document of the Association, including the Executive, each legislative body, the councils and commissions, and the Association office.
                4. The University may block the distribution of funds derived from a Undergraduate Student Activities Fee to any cause that it finds to be contrary to the policies and/or regulations established by the University, or outside of the educational mission of the University. The Financial Manager shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with any such University mandate, and shall not be penalized for any actions taken consistent with such a mandate.
        4. Funds disbursed according to a specific budget and/or purpose may not be spent except in a manner that follows that specific budget and/or purpose. The Financial Manager shall have the responsibility for ensuring that such budgets are followed, within the regulations established by the relevant legislative bodies and within the financial policies that the Financial Manager may enact.
        5. Any account funded by student fees shall not receive funding for salaries or stipends for any member of the Association.

            By the end of the sixth week of Spring Quarter, the Financial Manager shall devise and submit to the Association legislative bodies, for approval, a schedule for the levying of all Undergraduate Student Activities Fees. This collection schedule must conform to the following three principles:
            1. The amount levied during each of Autumn, Winter, and Spring quarters shall be substantially the same. This fee shall not be levied during the Summer quarter.
            2. The amount levied on each student each quarter shall be an integral amount of dollars. The schedule may add a rounding surcharge, which shall be the minimum practical to accomplish this goal.
            3. The schedule shall specify the exact amount of administrative overhead charged to each fee.
        2. Collection of Fees
            1. The University shall collect the appropriate amount every quarter at the same time it collects charges for tuition.

            3. the appropriate financial accounts.
    3. Distribution of Fees
        1. Oversight of Fees
            1. The Undergraduate Senate shall retain ultimate authority over the disbursement of money from an Undergraduate Student Activities Fee, subject only to the limitations imposed by this Constitution.
                1. Where the Fee Statement of a Fee delegates authority to distribute funds to another body of the Association, the Undergraduate Senate shall have the power to overrule any decision of that Association body by a 2/3 vote, provided previous notice has been given; however, they shall not have the power to propose measures to be approved.
                2. Where the Fee Statement of a Fee delegates authority for a decision to the population upon which the fee is charged (e.g., by general election), the relevant legislative bodies shall have no power to overrule any decision so enacted.
            2. All substantial actions taken by an Association legislative body that affect the operation or distribution of a Fee shall require a 2/3 recorded vote. Previous notice must be given for such actions. Where provided in the Fee Statement of a Fee, this section does not apply to actions taken by a legislative body to approve routine disbursements of fee money.
        2. Allocable amounts
            1. The allocable amount of a Fee shall be the total amount that may be disbursed from that Fee in a fiscal year. The Financial Manager shall not disburse funds from a Fee if such disbursement would cause the total amount disbursed to exceed the allocable amount.
            2. The allocable amount of a Fee shall be calculated as: the gross amount received from the fee, minus the administrative surcharge charged to the fee, minus all waivers granted, plus the gross amount of reserve and excess funds added to the allocable amount.
                1. The allocable amount for a Fee shall be approximately budgeted according to this calculation in the Spring Quarter by the Financial Manager, and this budget shall be approved by the Undergraduate Senate.
                2. The Financial Manager may make adjustments to this formula in his/her discretion, and such adjustments shall be binding in the calculation of the allocable amount.
                3. The Financial Manager shall be responsible for making all estimations necessary in the calculation of the allocable amount, and his/her estimations shall be binding in the calculation of the allocable amount until actual figures are available to replace the estimations.
                4. The Constitutional Council shall have the power to resolve disputes arising from this section.
            3. The Financial Manager shall be responsible for monitoring the total disbursed amount, ensuring that the allocable amount reflects the most accurate available data, and providing regular updates to the relevant bodies about the status of all Fees.
            4. The Financial Manager may adjust the allocable amount at any time where it is necessary to ensure that the Association retains sufficient liquid assets to pay expenses, including but not limited to monies previously disbursed from that Fee.
        3. Excess Funding
            1. If any amount of any allocation from an Undergraduate Student Activities Fee remains unspent at the close of the fiscal year, the Fee Statement for that fee shall provide instructions for transferring the remaining funds.
    4. Waiver of Undergraduate Student Activities Fees
        1. Any member of the Association shall be entitled to a full refund of any fees he/she paid to the Association under this Article. This amount shall be specified in the collection schedule for the fees, and should be as close as practical to the actual per-member amount collected for the fee in question.
        2. The Fee Statement of a fee may contain rules designed to aid students in choosing which portions of that fee to waive.
        3. Obtaining a waiver may deprive the member of the Association of some or all of the services derived from the fee.
    5. Routine Analysis of Funding System
        1. Three years after the full implementation of the system, and every three years thereafter, the ASSU Financial Manager shall call a special meeting of the Executive Committee and develop a plan to analyze the funding system. By the first meeting of Spring Quarter, the Executive Committee shall jointly present a report detailing the impact of the funding system, and propose any appropriate changes to ensure the funding system results in optimal outcomes for students and student organizations.
        2. The analysis shall include, at minimum, a public survey and analysis of financial data from the past three years.

        1. General
            1. All Association funds shall be expended within the purposes of the Association, and within the educational purposes of the University. All funds derived from fees levied upon members of the Association shall be expended within the educational purposes of the University.
            2. No funds shall be received or expended by the Association or its agencies unless authorized by the Operating Budget or Capital Budget of the Association or by the budget of the relevant Association agency. Authorization shall consist of the approval by the relevant Association legislative bodies of the appropriate budget or a modification thereof.

            An initiative measure shall be submitted to the members of the Association for their approval or rejection according to one of the following procedures:
            1. For resolutions, “advisory referenda”, or other initiatives whose only purpose is to express an opinion, or to take such symbolic action as may be incidental to the expression of that opinion:
                1. The resolution may be placed on the ballot by the relevant Association legislative bodies.
                2. If a petition of 5 percent of a population of the Association, containing the text of the resolution, is submitted to the Elections Commission at least 21 days prior to the Association Spring Quarter General Election, or at least 14 days prior to any other previously called election involving that population, the Commission shall, unless it or either Association legislative body determines the petition not to be in good order within the limitations of this Constitution, place the initiative on the ballot for the specified population for the specified election. “Not in good order” shall include, but not be limited to, an inappropriate choice of population. Petitions covering the entire membership of the Association must bear the signatures of 5 percent of the graduate and undergraduate populations separately.
            2. For all other initiative measures:
                1. The initiative may be placed on the ballot by the relevant Association legislative bodies.
                2.

Petitions covering then entire membership of the Association must bear the signatures of 15 percent of the graduate and undergraduate populations separately.
            2. Once a petition seeking a referendum on a piece of legislation enacted by an Association legislative body has been found to be valid, that piece of legislation shall be suspended pending the outcome of the referendum election. In particular, any funds budgeted or allocated by that Association legislative body which had not been expended or encumbered before the referendum qualified for the ballot shall be frozen pending the outcome of the election. However, any action taken by officers of the Association pursuant to an item of legislation approved by an Association legislative body after it was initially approved, and before a referendum had qualified for the ballot, shall continue to be valid.

                2. If the Commission does not make a determination as to the authenticity of the signatures and their sufficiency in number within 7 days after the petitions have been submitted, its responsibilities devolve upon the President of the Association, or, in the case of a petition to recall the President or the Vice President of the Association, upon the relevant Association legislative body. The President of the Association (or the relevant Association legislative body, if the responsibility devolves upon it) must make its determination as to the authenticity of the signatures and their sufficiency in number within 5 days after such responsibility has devolved upon it from the Elections Commission. If the petitions are determined to be in order, the Elections Commission shall call and conduct a recall election on two consecutive days not less than 10 nor more than 21 days after the petitions were determined to be in order.
                3. The Constitutional Council shall have the power to investigate any fraud or wrongdoing in the process outlined in section 2(b) above. If such fraud is found, the Council may by a majority vote overturn any ruling on the validity of recall petitions.

The Association legislative bodies may not delay such an election except as provided in section F(1) below.
            2. Petitions bearing a call for elections may simultaneously bear initiatives, referenda, recalls, amendments to this Constitution. All such simultaneous legislation shall be placed on the ballot in the election, along with any other measures awaiting the approval of that population of the Association.
            3. Such elections shall be held in accordance with the rules and regulations set down previously by the Association legislative bodies for an election open to that population of the Association.
            4. The Elections Commission shall have the power to certify the results of such an election. Any questions about the validity of the election results shall be referred to the Constitutional Council which shall rule by majority vote on the election’s validity.

            To the maximum extent practical, exactly 100% of the Undergraduate Fee should be spent every year, to give students the benefit of the money they paid. Administrative surcharges are excluded.
        4. Disbursement
            1. The Undergraduate Fee shall be disbursed in three processes, known as Annual Grants, Standard Grants, and Quick Grants. The rules governing each process are provided in this Fee Statement.
            2. The Undergraduate Senate, and its Appropriations Committee, shall oversee most decisions, as provided in this Fee Statement.
            3. Wherever practical, the distribution of the Undergraduate Fee and any graduate fees shall be coordinated to reflect the approximate benefit that undergraduate and graduate students receive from any distribution of funds.
            4. The Undergraduate Senate shall attempt to allocate exactly the amount of allocable funds derived from the fee each quarter. The Financial Manager shall determine the apportionment of Annual Grants funds among each quarter to provide maximum opportunity for Standard and Quick Grants while ensuring the stability of the Association cash flow.
    2. Annual Grants
        1. General
            Annual Grants shall be allocated prior to the beginning of Fall Quarter each year. Annual Grants shall be the primary means of funding large expenses from the Undergraduate Fee.
        2. Approval of Annual Grants
            1.  Annual Grants shall be given only for expenses that can be predicted accurately. Accurate predictions shall include, but are not limited to, actual figures from one or more previous similar expenses, or actual quotes for the proposed expenses. Expenses that cannot be predicted accurately, or expenses that are tentative, are not appropriate for Annual Grants.
            2. The Undergraduate Senate By-Laws shall set a timeline and a process for the approval of Annual Grants. The Undergraduate Senate shall enforce any deadlines strictly. Waivers shall only be given for exceptional circumstances, and require approval of the Undergraduate Senate.
            3. To request an Annual Grant, a student organization shall follow the standard process set by the Undergraduate Senate in their bylaws.
                1. The process shall require that the organization submits a specific budget detailing the expenses for which an Annual Grant is sought, a full current budget and a summary of actual expenditures to the Undergraduate Senate Appropriations Committee.
                2. The Undergraduate Senate Appropriations Committee shall have the power to modify requests as it sees fit, and shall recommend a full package of Annual Grants to the Undergraduate Senate for approval at least 31 days before the Spring Quarter General Election.
                3. The Undergraduate Senate must approve the package of recommended Annual Grant requests by a 2/3 vote; if the package of Annual Grants is not approved, the Appropriations Committee must propose a new package of Annual Grants requests within five days.
                4. The Elections Commissioner shall authorize the placement on the ballot of all approved Annual Grant requests. The ballot shall list an option to approve or deny the entire Annual Grants package at once. The ballot shall also give the voter the option to approve or deny each individual Annual Grant within the package.
            4. If a student organization is not satisfied with the Annual Grant approved in the standard process, they may petition the student body directly for a different Annual Grant.
                1. The organization shall prepare a budget detailing the expenses for which an Annual Grant is sought, and submit this, along with the current budget and a summary of actual expenditures, to the Elections Commissioner in the form of a petition. The budget detailing the expenses may only include expenses requested in the budget originally presented through the UG Senate’s standard process. Such petitions must bear the signatures of 15 percent of the members of the relevant Association population, and request the placement of the amended Annual Grant on the ballot for consideration.
                2. The Elections Commissioner must examine for authenticity the signatures on the petitions within seven days after receiving it. Upon verifying the petition, the Elections Commissioner shall place the Annual Grant on the ballot for consideration by the relevant population of the Association.
                3. The Undergraduate Senate shall have the authority to specify the form in which the detailed budget and summary of actual expenditures must be presented and the information they must contain, and to establish regulations defining the proper form for petitions and governing the circulation thereof.
                4. Petitions shall not be accepted less than seven days before the election, and the Elections Commission shall have the power to set a specific deadline consistent with this section that shall be binding upon groups.
                5. The ballot shall list the amended Annual Grant, and shall contain a statement approved by the Undergraduate Senate that explains why the Annual Grant is listed separately from the Annual Grants package. 
                6. The Association legislative bodies shall not have the power to remove an Annual Grant from the ballot which has properly qualified under this section.
                7. The Undergraduate Senate may, by 2/3 vote, allow an Annual Grant to qualify for the ballot under this section even if it has not properly qualified under this section due to extenuating circumstances.
        3. Approval by the Association
            All members of the Association who are charged the Undergraduate Fee shall be eligible to vote on each Annual Grant. During the general election, each member of the Association may cast one vote either in favor or in opposition to each Annual Grant. A vote in favor or against the Annual Grants package shall be construed to apply individually to each grant within the Annual Grants package, unless the voter has elected to give specific preferences as provided above. An Annual Grant shall be deemed to have passed if a majority of those voting on it were in favor.
            During the general election a summary of all financial information submitted by the student organization seeking an Annual Grant shall be made available to all members of the Association.
        4. Unapproved Annual Grants
            If an Annual Grant is not approved because a majority of voters did not approve the grant, the Undergraduate Senate shall not fund the same expenses in the same amounts through another process, and shall consider the Annual Grants rejection in their funding decisions.
        5. Modifications to an Annual Grant
            Although it is mandated that Annual Grants be allocated to expenses that can be projected accurately, if it becomes necessary, a group may request to modify the Annual Grant it received at any time during the fiscal year. This request shall pass by unanimous consent of the Appropriations Committee, or a 2/3 vote of the Undergraduate Senate.
    4. Standard Grants
        1. General
            Standard Grants shall be allocated routinely by the Undergraduate Senate, and shall be the primary means of funding large expenses that can be predicted a short time in advance.
            1. Applications for Standard Grants shall be solicited at most twice per month.
            2. The Undergraduate Senate Appropriations Committee, with the guidance of the Financial Manager, shall set allocation targets for Standard Grants funds to ensure the efficient distribution of events and the proper balancing of funds during each round to effect maximum benefit for the student body without reducing available funds during the year.
        2. Approval of Standard Grants
            1. The bylaws of the Undergraduate Senate shall set a timeline and a process for the approval of Standard Grants. The Undergraduate Senate shall enforce any deadlines strictly. Waivers shall only be given for exceptional circumstances, and require approval of the Undergraduate Senate.
            2. To request a Standard Grant, a student organization shall follow the standard process set by the Undergraduate Senate in their bylaws.
                1. The process shall require that the organization submits a specific budget detailing the expenses for which a Standard Grant is sought.
                2. The Undergraduate Senate Appropriations Committee may require additional materials to be submitted, and shall have the power to determine the form of the budgets to be submitted. The Appropriations Committee shall ensure that the process appropriately balances efficiency with the need for completeness.
            3. The Undergraduate Senate may, by majority vote, approve each Standard Grant. Grants that are not approved shall not be disbursed.
            4. The Financial Manager shall disburse approved Standard Grants as quickly as practical.
    5. Quick Grants
        1. General
            Quick Grants shall be allocated by the Appropriations Committee on an as-needed basis for expenses that could not be predicted in time for an Annual or Standard Grant. The Appropriations Committee should make all practical efforts to approve or deny Quick Grants within seven days of receipt, consistent with this section.
        2. Approval of Quick Grants
            1. The bylaws of the Undergraduate Senate shall set a timeline and a process for the approval of Quick Grants.
            2. To request a Quick Grant, a student organization shall follow the standard process set by the Undergraduate Senate in their bylaws.
                1. The process shall require that the organization submits a specific budget detailing the expenses for which a Quick Grant is sought.
                2. The Undergraduate Senate Appropriations Committee may require additional materials to be submitted, and shall have the power to determine the form of the budgets to be submitted. The Undergraduate Senate shall ensure that the process appropriately balances efficiency with the need for completeness.
            3. Quick Grants under $6,000 shall not require the approval of the Undergraduate Senate, though approval may be sought if the Undergraduate Senate Appropriations Committee deems it necessary, or if unanimous consent of the Appropriations Committee is not reached.
            4. Quick Grants of $6,000 or more shall require the 2⁄3 approval of the Undergraduate Senate prior to being disbursed.
            5. The Financial Manager shall disburse approved Quick Grants as quickly as practical.
    6. Class President Discretionary Funding
        1. General

            2. For events and initiatives that have expenses that can be reasonably projected in advance, the Undergraduate Senate shall make those funds available during the budgetary process in Spring Quarter.
            3. For events and initiatives that have expenses that cannot be reasonably projected in advance, the Undergraduate Senate shall make those funds available through Standard Grants.
            4. Quick Grant funds may not be allocated to Class Presidents.
    7. Reserve Funds
        1. General
            It is the intent of the undergraduate students of Stanford University to rein in the long-term growth of groups’ reserve funds. To balance this goal with the diverse reasons for groups to have retained reserve funds historically, all unspent funding allocated to a group in a given year through Annual Grants shall be taxed, unless otherwise exempted by the Undergraduate Senate. The remaining unspent funding that is not taxed shall be added to that individual group’s reserve account, if one currently exists. All unspent funding allocated to a group in a given year through Standard or Quick Grants will be automatically added to the allocable amount for the next year at the close of the fiscal year.
        2. Tax on Unspent Funding
            1. The Tax on Unspent Funding shall be assessed on the total amount of funding (from Annual, Standard, or Quick grants) unspent in a given fiscal year.
            2. Tax rates will be indexed to the size of a group’s existing reserve funds, plus its amount of unspent funds, as a percentage of its budget in a fiscal year.
            3. For the purposes of this subsection, a group’s “budget” will be defined as the sum of its Annual, Quarterly, and Quick grant allocations in a given fiscal year.
            4. The Financial Manager will have the power to set progressive tax rates, subject to majority approval by the Undergraduate Senate. No tax rate shall exceed 100%.
            5. For groups with reserve holdings no greater than 80% of their budget, the Tax on Unspent Funding shall be 0%.
            6. Revenue from the Tax on Unspent Funding will be deposited in a fund to support Standard and Quick Grants in the next fiscal year.
        3. Exemption from the Tax on Unspent Funding
            1. The Undergraduate Senate shall have the power to exempt groups from the Tax on Unspent Funding.
            2. A group may apply for an exemption for one of the following reasons:
                1. Holding reserves to pay for up-front costs that are not covered entirely by other ASSU funding sources
                2. Extenuating circumstances that necessitate additional funds being held untaxed into the following fiscal year. Extenuating circumstances shall be discretionarily defined by the Financial Manager. The Undergraduate Senate may overrule.
            3. To request an exemption, a group shall submit a request to the Senate Appropriations Committee detailing, among other things:
                1. The reason they need an exemption
                2. The anticipated balance of their reserve account throughout the year
                3. The group’s requested maximum reserve amount
            4. An exemption may be approved by a 2/3 vote of the Undergraduate Senate.
            5. Every two years, the Appropriations Committee shall review the size and use of a group’s reserve during winter quarter to determine whether it is consistent with the group’s initial plan. Upon a 2⁄3 vote of the Undergraduate Senate, the group’s reserves shall be transferred into the Quick Grants Fund and the group will be unable to apply for an exemption in the next academic year.
    8. Waiver of the Undergraduate Fee
        1. Refund Schedule
            1. The Financial Manager shall set a timeline by which the Undergraduate Fee may be waived, consistent with the Constitution, this Fee Statement, the Association By-Laws, and the By-Laws of the Undergraduate Senate.
            2. This timeline shall occur once every quarter, excluding Summer Quarter.
            3. The Financial Manager may present a bill to alter or extend the timeline, and its approval shall require a 2/3 vote of the Undergraduate Senate.
        2. Waiver Buffer Surcharge
            1. The Association may set a surcharge on top of the Undergraduate Fee to guard against waivers of this fee.
            2. The amount charged shall be set annually by the Financial Manager, and shall be appropriately calculated according to the Undergraduate Fee waiver rate from the previous fiscal year.
            3. The Undergraduate Senate shall not have the power to alter the Waiver Buffer Surcharge, except through an amendment of the Association By-Laws, subject to approval by the Graduate Student Council.
        3. Undergraduate Buffer Fund
            1. If the amount charged by the Waiver Buffer surcharge exceeds the amount waived in the Undergraduate Fee refund process, then the excess funds shall be transferred into the Undergraduate Buffer Fund.
            2. The Association shall set an appropriate size for the Undergraduate Buffer Fund into its By-Laws, and annually, any excess funds above the set amount shall be transferred by the Financial Manager into the Standard and Quick Grants allocation pool for the following fiscal year.
            3. Beyond the agreed upon money that is transferred to Standard and Quick Grants, the Association may not spend money in the Undergraduate Buffer Fund that was collected through waivers of this Fee for any purpose unrelated to guarding against those waivers.
